Daytona Road is a drag-racing sim where every shift counts. Start with your first garage-built ride, master perfect gear shifts, and take on a lineup of rivals standing between you and the open road. Win races, earn coins, upgrade your car, and unlock new beasts built for pure speed.

Each race is simple to learn but tough to master — watch the RPMs, time your shifts, and leave your opponent in the dust. Defeat enough challengers and you’ll face powerful Boss racers whose vehicles and skills raise the stakes every step of the way.

Between races, upgrade your car’s power, speed, grip, and weight, or buy entirely new rides. Customize wheels, tune performance, and build the perfect setup for every length of track — ¼ mile, ½ mile, or full mile showdowns.

Explore a level map shaped like a cross-country highway, packed with 15 races across multiple regions. Or hop into Free Race mode for quick, no-pressure runs.

Daily bonus spins, achievements, multiple backdrops, and a full garage system keep progression fun and rewarding.

Hit the gas. Chase the horizon.
Your road to Daytona starts now.
